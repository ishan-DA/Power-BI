This Power BI project is designed to visualize the data collected from a survey of data professionals. The survey data includes information on job titles, salaries, higher education, and ethnicity of the respondents.

The dashboard provides an interactive interface to explore and analyze the data through various visualizations.

The data used in this project is sourced from a survey conducted by Alex The Analyst. The survey was conducted among data professionals across different industries and locations.

The dataset used in this project includes responses from over 500 data professionals. The data was preprocessed to remove any incomplete or inconsistent responses.


I hope that this dashboard will be useful for anyone looking to gain insights into the data professional industry.
